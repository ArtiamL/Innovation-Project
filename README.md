# Innovation-Project

A Raspberry Pi app for realtime object inference on animals. Each animal, once 'scanned' can be collected akin to the Pokédex found in popular game series 'Pokémon'. The core idea allows for children to 'collect' animals while learning about their habitats, diets & conservation status; encouraging a connection with nature and the effect humans may have on the coexisting inhabitants of Earth.
